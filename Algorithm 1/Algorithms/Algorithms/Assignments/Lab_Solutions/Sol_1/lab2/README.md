# Lab 2
## **Question 1** Comparing Algorithms
- (a) In this lab, **for all three algorithms** you will
- (b) write **the pseudo code**. (Must follow the notations and conventions used in today’s Lecture)
- (c) determine the worst case time complexity.

Compare your empirical results from W1D1 with W1D2. Are they consistent? What did you learn from
W1D1 and W1D2?

_Problem statement_

Find the largest distance between any two even integers in an integer array.
_Algorithm 1._

Create a new array consisting of even numbers only. Then use nested loops to solve the problem using
the newly created array of even numbers only.

_Algorithm 2._

Use a nested loop to solve the problem without creating an extra array.

_Algorithm 3._

Use one loop. Find max and min of even integers. Compute max – min.
